# 25+5 Clock
In this project we have created a timer for a work session and a break consecutively and running continously for effective work production and also ensuring quantity breaks for the user for rest.

The features of this 25+5 Clock is as follows:
1. By default it is set for a session of 25 minutes and a break of 5 minutes.
2. The user can start the timer using the Play button and then pause with the Pause button (both denoted by their symbols).
3. The user can increase or decrease the length of the session or length using the up and down arrows adjacent to their titles "Break" and "Session".
4. The user can't set the session or break less than zero or more than 60 minutes.
5. When a session or break gets over, a beep sound will start and won't stop until the reset button is pressed.
6. If the reset button is pressed anytime other than when the timer is ringing, it will rest the timer to it's default.
